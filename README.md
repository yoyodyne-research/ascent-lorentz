# ascent-lorentz
Lorentz example from Ascent, for Bela.

    cd ~/Bela/projects
    git clone git@github.com:yoyodyne-research/ascent-lorentz
    cd
    git clone git@github.com:yoyodyne-research/Ascent

then open and run `ascent-lorentz` in the Bela IDE.

This won't make any noises; it'll finish and drop a CSV into the project directory.
